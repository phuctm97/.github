# Contributing

Hi, thank you for considering contributing 💙!

Please contact [@phuctm97] directly if you can't an answer to your question
here.

## What to contribute?

Everything is subject to be iteractively improved, so anything that you see can
be improved or fixed is a contribution:

- Create an issue or DM [@phuctm97] to report a bug or typos, share your ideas,
  give feedback, etc.

- Update documentation.

- Refactor, deduplicate code to be more readable.

- Create a bugfix.

- Add a new feature.

## Conventions

The followings are conventions that we've commonly used. These are not hard
rules, please use them as suggestions and do what you think is right:

- Every commit starts with an emoji 🔨, 🙈, etc. There are neither rules, nor
  whitelists, nor blacklists, they add characters to the repository, so use
  which you think best describes a commit.

- Uses [Prettier] wherever possible. It is standardized and requires zero
  configuration.

## Making changes

Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a PR to the **default
branch** (`master` or `main`). If what you're thinking of making is considerably
complex or introduces breaking changes, please consider creating an issue or
directly contact [@phuctm97] first.
