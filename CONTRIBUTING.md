# Contributing

Hi, thank you for considering contributing 💙!

Please contact [@phuctm97] directly if you can't find your answer here.

## What to contribute?

Everything here is created to be iteractively improved, so anything that you see
can be improved or fixed is a contribution:

- Create an issue or DM [@phuctm97] to report a bug or typo, share your ideas.

- Update documentation as you discovered.

- Refactor, deduplicate code to be more readable.

- Create a bugfix.

- Add a new feature.

## Conventions

The followings are some conventions that I'm commonly using across repositories.
These are not hard rules, use these as suggestions and do whatever you think is
right:

- Every commit starts with an emoji 🔨, 🙈, etc. There are no rules, whitelists,
  or blacklists, they are used to add characters to the repository, so use
  whatever you think best describes a commit.

- Uses [Prettier] wherever possible. It is standardized, simple, zero
  configuration, and maintenance.

## Adding features/documentation

Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit a PR to the **default
branch** (`master` or `main`). If what you're thinking of making is considerably
complex or introduces breaking changes, please consider creating an issue or
directly contact [@phuctm97] first.
